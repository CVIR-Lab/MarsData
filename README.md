# MarsData
## a small-scale Martian rock dataset with labeled mask for rock segmentation.
We refined and built a labeled benchmark dataset called **MarsData**, for rock instance detection on planet excepically Mars. All the images are collected from a large [unlabeled dataset](https://dominikschmidt.xyz/mars32k/). The intention of MarsData is 
Currently, MarsData includes a simple rock 362 dataset, Rock-A with a few rocks in one scene and a 363 challenging dataset, Rock-B with more abundant rocks 364
in one image, and Rock-C is the hard one with much more rocks in on scene.
