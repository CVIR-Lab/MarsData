# MarsData
## a small-scale Martian rock dataset with labeled mask for rock segmentation.
We refined and built a labeled benchmark dataset called **MarsData**, for rock instance detection on planet excepically Mars. All the images are collected from a large [unlabeled dataset](https://dominikschmidt.xyz/mars32k/). The intention of **MarsData** is to provied a standard rock detection benchmark on instance level for researchers who are interseting on deep learning methods for earth and planetray geosciences. 

Currently, **MarsData** includes three sub-datasets, **Rock-A**, **Rock-B** and **Rock-C** with total 861 rock images and more than 25,000 rocks. 

**Rock-A** is a simple rock dataset with a few rocks in one scene. **Rock-B** is a challenging dataset with more abundant rocks in one image, and **Rock-C** is the hardest one with much complex and more rocks in on scene.
