# MarsData
## a Martian rock dataset for segmentation.
We refined and built a labeled dataset called **MarsData** in our paper(A Kernel-based Multi-featured Rock Modeling and Detection Framework for a Mars Rover), for rock segmentation on planet excepically on Mars. Images are collected from an unlabeled [Mars image dataset](https://dominikschmidt.xyz/mars32k/). The intention of **MarsData** is to provied a standard rock detection benchmark with pixel-level mask for researchers who are interseting on deep learning methods for planetray sciences and robotics. Note: All mars images are courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech. You can read the full use policy [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jpl-image-use-policy).

Currently, **MarsData** includes two sub-datasets, **Rock-A**, **Rock-B** with total 405 labeled rock images and more than 20,000 rocks. **Rock-A** is a simple rock dataset with a few rocks in one scene. **Rock-B** is a challenging dataset with more abundant rocks in one image. We will continue to improve **MarsData**, planing to build a more complex and challenging sub-dataset(tentatively named **Rock-C**), and striving to reach more than 1000 labeled images. Anyone who wants join us to further optimize and improve **MardData** is strongly welcome. Besides, we are applying for the data of China's First Mars Exploration Mission("TianWen-1"), looking for passionate researchers to collaborate with us!
